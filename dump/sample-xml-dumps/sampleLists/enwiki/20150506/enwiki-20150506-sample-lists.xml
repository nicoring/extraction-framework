The '''mountains and hills of Great Britain''', and to a lesser extent '''[[Ireland]]''', are the subject of a considerable number of '''lists''' that categorise them by [[elevation|height]], [[topographic prominence]], or other criteria. They are commonly used as a basis for [[peak bagging]], whereby [[hillwalking|hillwalkers]] attempt to reach all the summits on a given list. The oldest and best known of these lists is that of the [[Munro]]s, [[mountain]]s in Scotland over {{convert|3000|ft|sigfig=3}}; other well-known lists include the Corbetts, Wainwrights and [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyns]]. 

There is no worldwide consensus on the definition of &quot;mountain&quot;, but in Great Britain and Ireland it is often taken to be any summit at least 2,000 feet (or 610 metres) high.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuttall 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[http://www.ucd.ie/gsi/pdf/34-1/hills.pdf] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government defines ''mountain'' as land over 600 metres for the purposes of freedom of access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/37/pdfs/ukpga_20000037_en.pdf ''Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000''], Part 1, Chapter 1, Section 1(2). Accessed on 14 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some definitions also include a [[topographical prominence]] requirement, typically 100 feet (30 m) or 500 feet (152 m).&lt;ref name=&quot;G4AW&quot;/&gt; In practice, mountains in [[Scotland]] are frequently referred to as &quot;hills&quot; no matter what their height, as reflected in names such as the ''[[Cuillin]] Hills'' and the ''[[Torridon Hills]]''.  In Wales, the distinction is more a term of land use and appearance which has nothing to do with height.

==Scotland==

===Munros===
[[File:BenHopefromLochEriboll.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ben Hope]], the most northerly [[List of Munros|Munro]]]]
{{Main|Munro}}
The '''Munros''' are mountains in Scotland over 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft (914.4 m). The list was originally compiled by Sir [[Hugh Munro]] in 1891, and is modified from time to time by the [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]] (SMC).&lt;ref name=&quot;munros&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Bearhop | first=D.A. | year=1997 | title=Munro's Tables | isbn=0-907521-53-3 | publisher=Scottish Mountaineering Club &amp; Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most other lists, the Munros do not depend on a rigid [[topographic prominence|prominence]] criterion for entry; instead, those that satisfy the subjective measure of being a &quot;separate mountain&quot; are regarded as ''Munros'', while subsidiary summits are given the status of ''tops''. There are 282 Munros and 227 further tops, all of them in the [[Scottish Highlands]].

*[[List of Munros]]

===Corbetts===
[[File:Merrick galloway.JPG|thumb|[[Merrick, Galloway|Merrick]] is both a [[List of Corbetts|Corbett]] and a [[List of Donalds|Donald]]]]
The '''Corbetts''' are peaks in Scotland that are between {{convert|2500|and|3000|ft|sigfig=4}} high with a [[topographic prominence| prominence]] of at least {{convert|500|ft|sigfig=4}}. The list was compiled in the 1920s by [[John Rooke Corbett]], a Bristol-based climber and SMC member, and was published posthumously after his sister passed it to the SMC.&lt;ref name=&quot;munros&quot;/&gt; 221 Corbetts, many of them in areas of Scotland with no [[Munro]]s, include [[Moidart]], [[Ardgour]], the [[Southern Uplands]] and the islands of [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], [[Rùm]] and [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]].

* [[List of Corbetts]]

A list of '''Corbett Tops''', covering every mountain in Scotland with between {{convert|2500|and|3000|ft|sigfig=4}} of height and between 
{{convert|100|and|500|ft|sigfig=4}} of relative height, was published by Alan Dawson in 2001. There are currently 449 of them.

===Donalds===

The '''Donalds''' are mountains in the [[Scottish Lowlands]] over 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft (609.6 m). The list was compiled by Percy Donald, and is maintained by the SMC.&lt;ref name=&quot;munros&quot;/&gt;  Whether a high point is a Donald is determined by a complicated formula. A mountain with a prominence of at least {{convert|30|m}} is automatically a Donald, but one with a relative height of {{convert|15|m}} may be one if it is of sufficient topographic interest. There are 140 Donalds, comprising 89 mountains and 51 tops.

* [[List of Donalds]]

===Grahams===

The '''Grahams''' are mountains in Scotland between 2000 and 2499 feet high (609.6 and 762 metres), with a drop of at least 150 metres (492 feet) all round. The list of mountains fitting these criteria was first published by Alan Dawson in ''The Relative Hills of Britain''&lt;ref name=&quot;rhb&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Alan | year=1992 | title=The Relative Hills of Britain | publisher=Cicerone Press | location=Milnthorpe | isbn=1-85284-068-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the Elsies (LCs, short for Lesser Corbetts). They were later named Grahams after the late Fiona Torbet (née Graham) who had compiled a similar list around the same time. Dawson continues to maintain the list, which contains 223 [[hill]]s distributed as follows: Highlands south of the Great Glen 91, Highlands north of the Great Glen 84, Central and Southern Scotland 23, Skye 10, Mull 7, Harris 3, Jura 2, Arran 1, Rum 1, South Uist 1. The number of Grahams was reduced by one from 224 following a survey in March 2014 that showed Corwharn to be only 609.0 metres (1998 feet) high.

* [[List of Grahams]]

Dawson in 2004 published a list of '''Graham Tops''' covering Scotland down to 610m of height and 30m of relative height. There are 998 of them, including the 223 Grahams.

===Murdos===
[[File:Aonach beag.jpg|thumb|[[Aonach Beag]], one of the &quot;mini&quot; Murdos]]

The '''Murdos''' are an attempt to apply objective criteria to the [[Munro]]s and their associated tops. They comprise all the summits in Scotland over {{convert|3000|ft|sigfig=4}} with a [[topographic prominence|prominence]] of at least {{convert|30|m}}. There are currently 443 Murdos, compared to 283 Munros or 510 Munros plus tops. The list was compiled by Alan Dawson.&lt;ref name=&quot;murdos&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Murdos | last=Dawson | first=Alan | url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/murdos/ | isbn=0-9522680-3-5 | publisher=TACit Press | location=Cambuskenneth, Stirling | year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Murdos are also Munro Tops, but many Munro Tops fail to qualify as Murdos because of insufficient relative height. Before 1997 there were seven Murdos that were ''not'' Munro Tops, some with quite substantial relative heights.&lt;ref&gt;Murdos designated new Munro Tops in 1997, http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/murdos/sevensum.html&lt;/ref&gt;  All seven were included in the 1997 edition of Munro's Tables, plus two non-Murdos: Little Pap on Lochnagar and Knight's Peak on Sgurr nan Gillean. The addition of Knight's Peak, on the basis of an altimeter measurement, was controversial and it was only accepted as a Murdo in 2009, some time after being re-surveyed as 915m by the [[Ordnance Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;Steam driven altimeter no more, http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tac/tac69/tac69steamdri.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Little Pap has an estimated drop of only 22 metres&lt;ref name=dibh&gt;{{cite web |title=Database of British and Irish Hills |url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html |accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the reason for its re-introduction to the list, following its removal in the 1981 edition of Munro's Tables,&lt;ref&gt;The Munros and Tops 1891–1997, http://www.hills-database.co.uk/downloads.html#munrotab&lt;/ref&gt; is unclear.

==Outside Scotland==

===Furths===
[[File:Caher, Macgillycuddy's Reeks - geograph.org.uk - 113638.jpg|thumb|Caher, one of the Irish [[Furths]]]]
'''Furths''' are those mountains in Great Britain and Ireland [[wikt:furth|furth]] (i.e. &quot;outside of&quot;) Scotland that would otherwise qualify as Munros.

They are sometimes referred to as the Irish, English or Welsh Munros. There are 34 furths; fifteen in Wales, thirteen in Ireland and six in England. The highest is [[Snowdon]].  The [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]] (SMC) maintains the list and records the claims of Munroists who go on to complete the Furths.

* [[List of Furths]]

===Nuttalls===
[[File:Skiddaw and Little Man.JPG|thumb|[[Skiddaw]], an English Nuttall]]
The '''Nuttalls''' are mountains in England and Wales over {{convert|2000|ft|m|0}} with a relative height of at least {{convert|15|m}}. There are 444 Nuttalls in total (254 in England and 190 in Wales). The list was compiled by [http://www.nuttalls.com/ John and Anne Nuttall] and published in two volumes, ''The Mountains of England &amp; Wales''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuttall 2008&quot;/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last=Nuttall
| first=John &amp; Anne
| title=The Mountains of England &amp; Wales – Volume 1: Wales
| edition= 3rd
| year=2009
| publisher=Cicerone
| location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria
| isbn=1-85284-304-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

By including high points that rise by as little as {{convert|15|m}} above their surroundings, the list of Nuttalls is sometimes criticised for including too many insignificant minor tops. The Hewitts (see below) are one attempt to avoid this.

With the exception of Pillar Rock, a rocky outcrop on [[Pillar (Lake District)|Pillar]] in the [[Lake District]], the peaks of all of the Nuttalls can be reached without resort to [[climbing|rock climbing]]. {{As of|2008|alt=As of December 2008}}, 163 people are known to have completed the list, though this includes some who did not climb Pillar Rock, which the authors permit.

===Hewitts===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of Hewitts and Nuttalls in England]] --&gt;
[[File:Pen-yr-ole-wen.jpg|thumb|[[Pen yr Ole Wen]], a Welsh Hewitt]]
The '''Hewitts''' are '''H'''ills in '''E'''ngland, '''W'''ales and '''I'''reland over '''T'''wo '''T'''housand feet (609.6&amp;nbsp;m), with a relative height of at least {{convert|30|m}}.

The list addresses one of the criticisms of the Nuttalls by requiring hills to have a relative height of {{convert|30|m}}, thus excluding the 125 least prominent Nuttalls from the list.

There are 528 Hewitts in total: 179 in England, 138 in Wales and 211 in Ireland.  The current TACit booklets contain 525 mountains, with Black Mountain being counted in both England and Wales.  Since their publication in 1997, Birks Fell in England and Mynydd Graig Goch have been added and Black Mountain deemed to be in Wales only.

Scottish mountains are, by definition, excluded. Those that meet the criteria are published in three parts: the Murdos,&lt;ref name=&quot;murdos&quot;/&gt; the Corbett Tops,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Corbett Tops and Corbetteers | last=Dawson | first=Alan |author2=Hewitt, Dave  | isbn=0-9534376-1-2 | publisher=TACit Press | location=Cambuskenneth, Stirling | year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Graham Tops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Graham Tops and Grahamists | last=Dawson | first=Alan | coauthors=Clements, E.D.&amp;nbsp;'Clem'; Gordon, James | isbn=0-9534376-2-0 | publisher=TACit Press | location=Cambuskenneth, Stirling | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wainwrights===

The '''Wainwrights''' are mountains or hills (locally known as ''[[fells]]'') in the English [[Lake District National Park]] that have a chapter in one of [[Alfred Wainwright]]'s ''[[Pictorial Guides to the Lakeland Fells]]''. There are 214 in the seven guides. There are no qualifications for inclusion other than an implied requirement of being at least {{convert|1000|ft|m}} high, to which [[Castle Crag]] in Borrowdale is the sole exception. A further 116 summits were included in the supplementary guide, ''[[The Outlying Fells of Lakeland]]''.

===Birketts===

The '''Birketts''' are all the fell tops over 1000 feet high (about 305&amp;nbsp;m) within the boundaries of the [[Lake District National Park]]. Height and location but not prominence are the criteria. There are 541 of these tops. Naturally, they do not include Wainwright's Castle Crag in Borrowdale, but they do include two higher Castle Crags (one above Thirlmere and one above Haweswater). The list was devised by Bill Birkett as the basis for his book ''Complete Lakeland Fells''.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Birkett, ''Complete Lakeland Fells'', London: HarperCollins / Premier Books (1994), ISBN 0583-32209-3&lt;/ref&gt; They are listed in the Database of British and Irish Hills.&lt;ref name=dibh/&gt;

==Marilyns==
[[File:Pillar and Rock.jpg|thumb|[[Pillar (mountain)|Pillar]], an English [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyn]]]]

{{Main|Marilyn (geography)}}

The '''Marilyns''' are mountains and hills in the British Isles that have a [[Topographic prominence|prominence]] of at least 150&amp;nbsp;metres (492&amp;nbsp;ft), regardless of absolute height or other merit. There are currently 1,554 Marilyns in Great Britain: 1,214 in Scotland, 179 in England, 158 in Wales and 5 on the [[Isle of Man]] ([[Black Mountain, Wales|Black Mountain]], on the [[England-Wales border]], is counted as being in Wales). There are a further 453 Marilyns in Ireland. The list was compiled and is maintained by Alan Dawson.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhb&quot;/&gt; The name was coined as an ironic contrast to the designation ''Munro'', which is homophonous with [[Marilyn Monroe|''(Marilyn) Monroe'']].

==County tops==

Climbing in the highest point of each county within a country or region is another popular form of [[peak bagging]], dating back at least to the 1920s when [[John Rooke Corbett]] was attempting to visit all British county tops.

== Others ==

=== Deweys ===
The '''[[Dewey (hill)|Deweys]]''' list are hills in England or Wales over 500 metres (1,640 feet) in altitude, but below 2,000 feet (609.6 metres), with a [[topographic prominence|prominence]] of at least 30 metres (98&amp;nbsp;feet).  The list was published by Michael Dewey in 1995.

=== Hardys ===
A '''[[Hardy (hill)|Hardy]]''' is the highest point of a UK hill range, of a British Isle over 1,000 acres (4 km²) or of top-tier administrative area (mainly County Tops). There are 342 Hardys: of 61 hill ranges, 91 islands and 190 administrative areas. 178 are in England, 31 in Wales, 107 in Scotland and 26 in Northern Ireland.  The list was first compiled in the 1990s by Ian Hardy.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, Ian, MVO (2010). ''The Hardys – The UK's High Points'' (3rd Edition). Potters Bar, Hertfordshire: Ian Hardy. ISBN 978 0 9565533 3 1 (internet version, http://www.thehardys.org/), ISBN 978 0 9565533 5 5 (DVD version).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HuMPs ===
The Marilyns were supplemented in 2007 by the '''HuMPs''' (Hundred Metre Prominence) which reduces the [[Topographic prominence|Prominence]] requirement to 100m. The list was compiled by Mark Jackson from a large number of sources and published online in 2010 in ''More Relative Hills of Britain''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Mark|title=More Relative Hills of Britain|url=http://www.rhb.org.uk/humps/humps_1_1_0c.pdf|work=Relative Hills of Britain|accessdate=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are almost 3,000 British HuMPs, including three in the Channel Islands.

=== Tumps ===
{{For|other senses of the word Tump (e.g. the traditional name for a low mound)|Tump (disambiguation){{!}}Tump}}
More recently, Mark Jackson compiled the 'Tumps', a list of all hills in Britain having a prominence of 30 metres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhb.org.uk/marhofn/marhofn255/Marhofn255.pdf ''Marilyn Hall of Fame News''], May 2012, p.30. Accessed on 27 Mar 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, all Murdos, Corbett Tops, Graham Tops, Hewitts and Deweys are also Tumps. There are over 16,000 Tumps; approximately half of that number that did not appear in previously researched lists were researched by Mark Jackson between 2006 and 2009. Since 2012 the list has been published and maintained by the editors of The Database of British and Irish Hills.&lt;ref name=dibh/&gt;

==Peak bagging culture==

In the Lake District especially, there is a tradition of finding the maximum number of tops, including all the major summits, which can be visited in a 24 hour period – see [[Lakeland 24 hour record]]. This usually requires [[fell running]], and a support team. The pre-war record, set by [[Bob Graham Round|Bob Graham]], of 42 tops, has become a standard round, which has been repeated by over 1,000 people.

This is a '''list of mountains in England over 2,000 feet'''.

[[Hill lists in the British Isles#Nuttalls|Nuttalls]] are hills in [[England]] and [[Wales]] that are at least 2,000&amp;nbsp;[[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] (610&amp;nbsp;[[metre]]s) high with a [[Topographic prominence|relative height]] of at least 15&amp;nbsp;[[metre]]s (49.2&amp;nbsp;feet). The list was compiled by John and Anne Nuttall and published in ''The Mountains of England &amp; Wales''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Nuttall | first=John &amp; Anne | title=The Mountains of England &amp; Wales - Volume 2: England | edition=2nd edition | year=1990 | publisher=Cicerone | location=Milnthorpe, Cumbria | isbn=1-85284-037-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hill lists in the British Isles#Hewitts|Hewitts]] are hills in England, Wales and [[Ireland]] that are at least 2,000&amp;nbsp;feet high with a relative height of at least 30&amp;nbsp;m.   This list was compiled by Alan Dawson and originally published in ''The Relative Hills of Britain''&lt;ref name=&quot;rhb&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Dawson | first=Alan | year=1992 | title=The Relative Hills of Britain | url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/marilyns/ | publisher=Cicerone Press | location=Milnthorpe | isbn=1-85284-068-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the name ''Sweats''.  The list was subsequently renamed ''Hewitts'', updated, and published in ''The Hewitts and Marilyns of England''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hewitts and Marilyns of England | url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/england/ | last=Dawson | first=Alan | isbn=0-9522680-7-8 | publisher=TACit Press | location=Cambuskenneth, Stirling | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the inclusion of Ireland, the only difference between Nuttalls and Hewitts is that hills with a relative height between 15 and 30&amp;nbsp;m are Nuttalls but not Hewitts.  This corresponds to roughly a quarter of all Nuttalls, and the exclusion of these least prominent Nuttalls was one of the reasons why the list of Hewitts was produced.

In the tables below, rows have been coloured according to which list(s) the hills are on.  Hills that are ''additionally'' [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyns]] or that are on the [[List of mountains of the British Isles by relative height|list]] of hills with a 600&amp;nbsp;m drop are also distinguished.  In the parent column, the [[prominence parent]] is used where possible.  The prominence parent of a peak can be found by dividing the island or region in question into territories by tracing the runoff from the key col of every higher peak in the region. The prominence parent is the higher peak in whose territory the original peak resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peaklist.org/theory/theory.html |title=Prominence Theory |accessdate=2008-01-17 |author=Maizlish, Aaron |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 254 Nuttalls on the list, of which 179 are Hewitts, and 51 are Marilyns.

==Notes==
*{{note|1|1}} [[Honister Crag]] was discovered to have the enough relative height to qualify as a Nuttall after publication of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nuttalls.com/mountains/honister%20crag.htm | last=Nuttall | first=John &amp; Anne | title=Honister Crag (or Black Star) | year=2004 | accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{note|2|2}} [[Birks Fell]] was resurveyed in 2006 and discovered to be 610&amp;nbsp;m and not 608&amp;nbsp;m as previously thought.  This not only pushes it over the 2000&amp;nbsp;ft mark needed for inclusion on these lists, but also raises it above neighbouring [[Horse Head Moor]] (609&amp;nbsp;m), making it a Marilyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nuttalls.com/news/0022.htm | last=Nuttall | first=John &amp; Anne | title=Birks Fell — Officially a new mountain | year=2006 | accessdate=2007-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{note|3|3}} The [[Black Mountain, Wales|Black Mountain]] straddles the English–[[Wales|Welsh]] border and was formerly listed in The Relative Hills of Britain and the TACit Tables as belonging to both England and Wales.  With effect from May 2007, Black Mountain is deemed to be in Wales only for the purposes of lists and databases, and such evidence as exists points that way.  The Nuttalls have always listed Black Mountain as being in Wales only.

'''[[Hill lists in the British Isles#Hewitts|Hewitts]]''' are hills in England, Wales and [[Ireland]] that are at least {{convert|2000|ft|m}} high with a relative height of at least 30&amp;nbsp;m.   The original list, covering only England and Wales, was compiled by Alan Dawson and originally published in ''The Relative Hills of Britain''&lt;ref name=&quot;rhb&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; under the name ''Sweats''.  The list was subsequently renamed ''Hewitts'' to include Ireland, updated, and published in a series of three booklets edited by Dave Hewitt: ''The Hewitts and Marilyns of Wales'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hewitts and Marilyns of Wales | last=Dawson | first=Alan | url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/wales/ | isbn=0-9522680-6-X | publisher=TACit Press | location=Cambuskenneth, Stirling | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Hewitts and Marilyns of England''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hewitts and Marilyns of England | last=Dawson | first=Alan | url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/england/ | isbn=0-9522680-7-8 | publisher=TACit Press | location=Cambuskenneth, Stirling | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Hewitts and Marilyns of Ireland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hewitts and Marilyns of Ireland | last=Clements | first=E.D.'Clem' | url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/tables/ireland.html | isbn=0-9522680-8-6 | publisher=TACit Press | location=Cambuskenneth, Stirling | year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article includes a list of characters from the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated series ''[[DuckTales]]''. Many of them previously appeared in the ''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' comic book series and other media pertaining to the Disney [[Duck universe]].

==McDuck household==
[[File:ScroogeWithNephews.jpg|thumb|250px|Scrooge, Huey, Dewey and Louie.]]
* '''[[Scrooge McDuck]]''' (voiced by [[Alan Young]]) is the richest duck in the world and the main [[protagonist]] of the series. Scrooge is constantly seeking ways to further increase his wealth (his favorite pastime appears to be treasure hunting), and to avoid losing it. The only thing Scrooge values more than money is his family.
* '''[[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey Duck, Dewey Duck, and Louie Duck]]''' (all voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]) are identical triplets and Scrooge's grandnephews. They are usually clothed in identical outfits that only differ in color—each of them wear a specific color.
** '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Huey Duck&lt;/span&gt;''' serves as the general leader of the trio and is very skilled at playing marbles. &lt;!-- from the episode Pearl of Wisdom --&gt;
** '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue;&quot;&gt;Dewey Duck&lt;/span&gt;''' is arguably the most clever of the three and sometimes fills in the role of leader over Huey.
** '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;Louie Duck&lt;/span&gt;''' is probably the most creative thinker of the bunch and more laid-back than his brothers.
* '''&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta;&quot;&gt;Webbigail &quot;Webby&quot; Vanderquack&lt;/span&gt;''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]) is the female child who secretly wants to be accepted as the fourth &quot;nephew&quot;. She resembles a very young Daisy Duck.
* '''Mrs. Bentina Beakley''' (voiced by [[Joan Gerber]] in the series, and [[Wendee Lee]] in the video game ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]'') is the maid and nanny of the household, and the maternal grandmother of Webby.
* '''Duckworth the Butler''' (voiced by [[Chuck McCann]]) is Scrooge's longtime, no-nonsense butler-chauffeur. Despite having &quot;Duck&quot; in his name, Duckworth is actually an [[anthropomorphic]] [[dog]]. He worked for Scrooge even before the nephews moved in. He is also Scrooge's chauffeur and errand boy on occasion. Duckworth used to be Scrooge's only household servant until Scrooge hired Mrs. Beakley. He usually appears as a supporting character. His only starring roles on the show are in the episode &quot;Duckworth's Revolt&quot; and the episode-segment &quot;Take Me Out of the Ballgame&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Duckworth's Revolt|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-26|season=1|number=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;'Magica's Magic Mirror' &amp; 'Take Me Out of the Ballgame'&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title='Magica's Magic Mirror' &amp; 'Take Me Out of the Ballgame'|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-30|season=1|number=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first appears in the first part of the pilot episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Don't Give Up the Ship&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Treasure of the Golden Suns (Part 1): Don't Give Up the Ship|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-09-18|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duckworth is a jack-of-all-trades in the McDuck mansion, making him an important member of Scrooge's staff.
* '''Bubba the Caveduck''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is a young caveduck that Scrooge adopts in the second season of the show after he stowed away in Gyro's Time Machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marking Time&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Time Is Money (Part 1): Marking Time|series=DuckTales|airdate=1988-11-24|season=2|number=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the introduction of GizmoDuck later in the second season, the character was dropped from the series almost entirely.
* '''Tootsie the Triceratops''' is Bubba's pet [[Triceratops]] who stowed away with Bubba in Gyro's Time Machine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marking Time&quot;/&gt;

==Friends==
* '''[[List of Donald Duck universe characters#Launchpad McQuack|Launchpad McQuack]]''' (voiced by [[Terry McGovern (actor)|Terry McGovern]]) is Scrooge's pilot. An able flyer, Launchpad can scarcely set a plane down without a massive crash, yet has survived numerous crashes without injury; he is also easily capable of aerial feats bordering on the impossible. As shown in the episode &quot;The Golden Goose (Part 2)&quot;, he can actually land a plane safely.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Golden Goose (Part 2)&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Golden Goose (Part 2)|series=DuckTales|airdate=1990-11-28|season=4|number=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later appeared as a main character in ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', appearing in most episodes of that series.
* '''[[Gyro Gearloose]]''' (voiced by [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] throughout the series, [[Barry Gordon]] in several episodes, and [[Chris Edgerly]] in the video game ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]'') is an inventor who often works for Scrooge, designing anything from relocation rays (&quot;The Money Vanishes&quot;) to time machines (&quot;Time Is Money&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Marking Time&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Money Vanishes&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Money Vanishes|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-05|season=1|number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being duped once in a while by the Beagle Boys, Gyro is generally extremely clever and resourceful. Often his inventions help drive an episode's plot, as they do not always work as designed—when anyone besides Gyro attempts to use them! However, the relocation ray does work too well for the Beagle Boys in the episode &quot;The Money Vanishes&quot;, as they trick Scrooge into spraying his money for a nonexistent bug.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Money Vanishes&quot;/&gt; Huey, Dewey, and Louie end up saving the day using the same ray.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Money Vanishes&quot;/&gt;
* '''Doofus Drake''' (voiced by [[Townsend Coleman]]) is a friend of Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and Launchpad's sidekick. Generally speaking, Doofus is a rather dim-witted and clumsy character, with a positive attitude as insatiable as his appetite. He exhibits hero worship for Launchpad, which frequently borders on the delusional. (The relationship between Doofus and Launchpad in many ways mirrors that of Launchpad and Scrooge.) Doofus is also marked by his strong moral compass, best demonstrated in the episode &quot;Superdoo!&quot;, in which he uses newly acquired superpowers to save the Junior Woodchucks from catastrophe only to voluntarily relinquish them for the sake of hard work and friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Superdoo!|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-09|season=1|number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Goldie O'Gilt]]''', a.k.a. '''[[Glittering Goldie]]''' (voiced by [[Joan Gerber]]), is Scrooge's love interest. An original Carl Barks character from the comic book story &quot;[[Back to the Klondike]]&quot; who appears in the ''DuckTales'' episode of the same name, Goldie's origins are as a music hall singer in [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Back to the Klondike&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Back to the Klondike|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-28|season=1|number=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Goldie is involved in the theft of Scrooge's recent gold find, she avoids dealing with the legal consequences by helping Scrooge work his claim at White Agony Creek.&lt;ref name=&quot;Back to the Klondike&quot;/&gt; Over the next several months the two fall in love, but the relationship ends when their gold is stolen and Scrooge believes Goldie is the culprit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Back to the Klondike&quot;/&gt; (Note that these events differ from Barks's version.) She later appeared in the episodes &quot;Scroogerello&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Scroogerello|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-11-24|season=1|number=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Till Nephews Do Us Part&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Till Nephews Do Us Part&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Till Nephews Do Us Part|series=DuckTales|airdate=1988-01-01|season=1|number=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Ducky Mountain High&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Ducky Mountain High|series=DuckTales|airdate=1990-09-10|season=4|number=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Fenton Crackshell]]''', a.k.a. '''[[Gizmoduck]]''' (voiced by [[Hamilton Camp]] in the series, and [[Eric Bauza]] in the video game ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]''), is Scrooge's accountant (as himself) and personal bodyguard (as Gizmoduck), hired by Scrooge in the show's second season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liquid Assets&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Super DuckTales (Part 1): Liquid Assets|series=DuckTales|airdate=1989-03-26|season=2|number=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Super DuckTales (Part 2): Frozen Assets|series=DuckTales|airdate=1989-03-26|season=2|number=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; He can count at a blazing speed, but he generally is incompetent with almost everything else. Furthermore, his regular dogged attempts to rectify his mistakes tends to make things worse until he ultimately succeeds. He exhibits a remarkably different personality in his role as Gizmoduck, as his high-powered suit gives him courage to make daring decisions and act as a strong leader and a hero. He makes a few guest appearances in ''[[Darkwing Duck]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Just Us Justice Ducks (Part 1)|series=Darkwing Duck|airdate=1991-10-02|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Just Us Justice Ducks (Part 2)|series=Darkwing Duck|airdate=1991-10-03|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Tiff of the Titans|series=Darkwing Duck|airdate=1991-10-19|season=1 (ABC)|number=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Up, Up and Awry&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Up, Up and Awry|series=Darkwing Duck|airdate=1991-11-14|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Darkwing Doubloon|series=Darkwing Duck|airdate=1991-12-16|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Gladstone Gander]]''' (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) is Scrooge's distant nephew who is, much to Scrooge's annoyance, unfailingly lucky. He had speaking roles in the episodes &quot;Dime Enough for Luck&quot; and &quot;Dr. Jekyl and Mr. McDuck&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Dime Enough for Luck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-04|season=1|number=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. McDuck|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-12-23|season=1|number=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made non-speaking cameo appearances in &quot;Sweet Duck of Youth&quot; and &quot;Till Nephews Do Us Part&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Till Nephews Do Us Part&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sweet Duck of Youth|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-10-21|season=1|number=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gladstone is far better known in the comic books.

==Villains==
* '''[[Flintheart Glomgold]]''' (voiced by [[Hal Smith (actor)|Hal Smith]] throughout the series, [[Ed Asner]] in several episodes, and [[Brian George]] in the video game ''[[DuckTales: Remastered]]'') is Scrooge's arch-rival, the main [[antagonist]] of the series, and the second-richest duck in the world. His first appearance in the series was in the second part of the pilot episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wronguay In Ronguay&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Treasure of the Golden Suns (Part 2): Wronguay In Ronguay|series=DuckTales|airdate=1987-09-18|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glomgold often comes up with schemes to earn more [[money]], often at Scrooge's expense, in order to surpass Scrooge and capture the title of World's Richest Duck. Early Barks sketches for Scrooge and Glomgold show remarkable similarities, especially in temperament. While the comics originally depicted Glomgold as a native of [[South Africa]], his origin was changed to [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent just like Scrooge. He made a cameo appearance in the ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'' episode &quot;In Like Blunt&quot;, along with the [[Beagle Boys]] and [[Magica de Spell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=In Like Blunt|series=Darkwing Duck|airdate=1992-02-24|season=1 (Disney Afternoon)|number=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SomeWheatiesBoxes.jpg|thumb|right|234px|Some Wheaties boxes with athletes or teams on the packaging, from the late 1990s.]]
In 1934, the [[breakfast cereal]] [[Wheaties]] began the practice of including pictures of [[sportsperson|athletes]] on its packaging to coincide with its [[slogan]], &quot;The Breakfast of Champions.&quot; In its original form, athletes were depicted on the sides or back of the cereal box, though in 1958 Wheaties began placing the pictures on the front of the box. The tradition has included hundreds of athletes from many different sports, and also team depictions.

This article lists the athletes or teams depicted on Wheaties boxes, along with the year(s) of depiction and sport played. This list is not all-inclusive, and athletes may have been shown together with teams and groups, or on the sides, back, or front of the box. Most athletes appeared on the standard Wheaties box, while others appeared on the Honey Frosted Wheaties (HFW), Crispy Wheaties 'n' Raisins (CWR), Wheaties Energy Crunch (WEC), or Wheaties Fuel (WF) boxes.

Traditional rank amongst European [[monarch|royalty]], [[peerage|peers]], and [[nobility]] is rooted in [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]]. Although they vary over time and between geographic regions (for example, one region's prince might be equal to another's grand duke), the following is a reasonably comprehensive list that provides information on both general ranks and specific differences.

== Ranks and titles ==
=== Sovereign ===
{{Main|Monarch|Sovereign}}
* The word ''monarch'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] μονάρχης, ''monárkhēs'', &quot;sole ruler&quot; (from μόνος, ''mónos'', &quot;single&quot; or &quot;sole&quot;, and {{lang|grc|ἄρχων}}, ''árkhōn'', [[archon]], &quot;leader&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;, &quot;chief&quot;, the word being the present participle of the verb ἄρχειν, ''árkhein'', &quot;to rule&quot;, &quot;to lead&quot;, this from the noun ὰρχή, ''arkhē'', &quot;beginning&quot;, &quot;authority&quot;, &quot;principle&quot;) through the [[Latin]]ized form ''monarcha''.
* The word ''sovereign'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''above''.
* [[Autocracy|Autocrat]] is derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|αὐτοκράτωρ}}: {{lang|grc|αὐτός}} (&quot;self&quot;) and {{lang|grc|κρατείν}} (&quot;to hold power&quot;), and may be translated as &quot;one who rules by himself&quot;.

;Common titles for European and Near Eastern monarchs
Note that many titles listed may also be used by lesser nobles – non-sovereigns – depending on the historical period and state. The sovereign titles listed below are grouped together into categories roughly according to their degree of dignity; these being: imperial, high royal, royal, others (princely, ducal, more), and religious.

'''Imperial titles'''
* '''[[Emperor]]''', from the Latin ''[[Imperator]]'', meaning &quot;commander&quot; or &quot;one who commands&quot;. In English, the feminine form is '''Empress''' (the Latin is ''imperatrix''). The realm of an emperor or empress is termed an ''Empire''. Other words meaning Emperor include:
** '''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''', the appellation of [[Rome|Roman]] emperors derived from the Roman dictator [[Julius Caesar]], whose great-nephew and adopted son [[Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus]] became the first emperor of Rome. Augustus' four successors were each made the adoptive son of his predecessor, and were therefore legally entitled to use &quot;Caesar&quot; as a constituent of their names; after Nero, however, the familial link of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] was disrupted and use of the word ''Caesar'' continued as a title only.
** '''[[Tsar]] / [[Czar]] / [[Csar]] / [[Tzar]]''', derived from Caesar, the feminine form ''[[Tsaritsa]]'', primarily used in Bulgarian, and after that in Russia and other Slavic countries.

* '''[[King]]''', from the Germanic ''*kuningaz'', roughly meaning &quot;son of the people.&quot; (See: [[Germanic kingship]]) &lt;ref name=&quot;sov&quot;&gt;Loss of sovereignty or [[fief]] does not necessarily lead to loss of title. The position in the ranking table is however accordingly adjusted. The occurrence of fiefs has changed from time to time, and from country to country.

A variant being the title of K'inich Ajaw or &quot;Great Sun King&quot; as it was used to refer to the founder of the [[Copán]] dynasty, [[K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']].
** '''[[Lakan]]''', [[Filipino language|Filipino]] title (mostly on the island of [[Luzon]]) which, together with the term '''[[Datu]]''' in the [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]], is an equivalent of ''Raja'' and thus glossed as &quot;king&quot; or &quot;sovereign prince&quot;.

=== Other sovereigns, royals, peerage, and major nobility ===
{{Main|Royal family|Peerage|Nobility|Imperial immediacy}}
Several ranks were widely used (for more than a thousand years in Europe alone) for both sovereign rulers and non-sovereigns. Additional knowledge about the territory and historic period is required to know whether the rank holder was a sovereign or non-sovereign. However, joint precedence among rank holders often greatly depended on whether a rank holder was sovereign, whether of the same rank or not. This situation was most widely exemplified by the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (HRE) in Europe. Almost all of the following ranks were commonly both sovereign and non-sovereign within the HRE. Outside of the HRE, the most common sovereign rank of these below was that of Prince. Within the HRE, those holding the following ranks who were also sovereigns had (enjoyed) what was known as an ''[[Imperial immediacy|immediate]]'' relationship with the Emperor. Those holding non-sovereign ranks held only a ''mediate'' relationship (meaning that the civil hierarchy upwards was mediated by one or more intermediaries between the rank holder and the Emperor).

; Titles
* '''[[Archduke]]''', ruler of an archduchy; used by the rulers of [[Austria]]; it was also used by the [[Habsburg]]s and [[Habsburg-Lorraine]]s of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Austrian Empire]], and the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] for imperial family members of the dynasty, each retaining it as a subsidiary title when founding sovereign [[cadet branch]]es by acquiring thrones under different titles (e.g., [[Grand Duke of Tuscany|Tuscany]], [[Duke of Modena|Modena]]); it was also used for those ruling some Habsburg territories such as those that became the modern BeNeLux (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg) nations
* '''[[Grand Prince]]''', ruler of a grand principality; a title primarily used in the medieval Russian principalities; it was also used by the [[Romanov]]s of the [[Russian Empire]] for members of the imperial family, although more commonly translated into English as ''Grand Duke''
* '''[[Duke]]''', ruler&lt;ref name=&quot;sov&quot; /&gt; of a [[duchy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;duke&quot;&gt;A duke who is not actually or formerly sovereign, or a member of a reigning or formerly reigning dynasty, such as British, French, Portuguese, Spanish and most Italian dukes, is a non-dynastic noble ranking above a marquis.&lt;/ref&gt; also for junior members of ducal and some grand ducal families
* '''[[Prince]]''', ''Prinz'' in German; junior members of a royal, grand ducal, ruling ducal or princely, or mediatised family. The title of ''[[Fürst]]'' was usually reserved, from the 19th century, for rulers of principalities—the smallest sovereign entities (e.g., Liechtenstein, Lippe, Schwarzburg, Waldeck-and-Pyrmont) -- and for heads of high-ranking, noble but non-ruling families (Bismarck, Clary und Aldringen, Dietrichstein, Henckel von Donnersmarck, Kinsky, Paar, Pless, Thun und Hohenstein, etc.). Cadets of these latter families were generally not allowed to use ''Prinz'', being accorded only the style of count (''[[Graf]]'') or, occasionally, that of ''Fürst'' (Wrede, Palffy d'Erdod) even though it was also a ruling title. Exceptional use of ''Prinz'' was permitted for some [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]] families (e.g., [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]], [[Montenuovo]]) and a few others (Carolath-Beuthen, Biron von Kurland).
** In particular '''[[Crown prince]]''', ''Kronprinz'' in German, was reserved for the heir apparent of an emperor or king
* '''[[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]]''', title of the crown prince of the royal family of [[France]]
* '''[[Infante]]''', title of the cadet members of the royal families of [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]
* [[prince-elector|'''Elector''']], ''Kurfürst'' in German, a rank for those who voted for the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], usually sovereign of a state (e.g. the Margrave of Brandenburg, an elector, called the ''Elector of Brandenburg'')
* '''[[Marquess]]''', '''[[Margrave]]''', or '''[[Marquis]]''' was the ruler of a [[Marches|marquessate]], [[Marches|margraviate]], or [[Marches|march]]
* '''[[Landgrave]]''', a German title, ruler of a landgraviate
* '''[[Count]]''', theoretically the ruler of a [[county]]; known as an '''[[Earl]]''' in modern Britain; known as a '''[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]''' in Montenegro and Serbia
* '''[[Viscount]]''' (vice-count), theoretically the ruler of a [[viscounty]] or [[viscounty|viscountcy]]
* '''[[Freiherr]]'''&lt;!-- this is not an English term --&gt;, holder of an [[Allodial title|allodial]] [[barony]]. ''Freiherr'' coming from the German &quot;Free-Man&quot;{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}
* '''[[Baron]]''', theoretically the ruler of a [[barony]] – some barons in some countries may have been &quot;free barons&quot; (''liber baro'') and as such, regarded (themselves) as higher barons.

Regarding the titles of duke and prince: in Germany, a sovereign duke (''Herzog'') outranks a sovereign prince (''Fürst''). A [[cadet]] prince (''Prinz'') who belongs to an imperial or royal dynasty, however, may outrank a duke who is the cadet of a reigning house e.g. [[Kingdom of Wurttemberg|Wurttemberg]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg]] or [[Grand Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]]. The children of a ruling grand duke might be titled duke (Mecklenburg, Oldenburg) or prince (Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Saxe-Weimar) in accordance with the customs of the dynasty.

Children of ruling dukes and of ruling princes (''Fürst'') were, however, all titled prince (''Prinz''). The heir apparent to a ruling or mediatised title would usually prepend the prefix ''Erb-'' (hereditary) to his or her title, e.g. '''''Erb'''herzog'', '''''Erb'''prinz'', '''''Erb'''graf'', to distinguish their status from that of their junior siblings. Children of a [[German mediatisation|mediatised]] ''Fürst'' were either ''Prinzen'' or ''Grafen'', depending upon whether the princely title was limited to descent by masculine [[primogeniture]] or not. In the German non-sovereign nobility, a duke (''Herzog'') still ranked higher than a prince (''Fürst'').

=== Minor nobility, gentry, and other aristocracy ===
{{Main|Aristocracy (class)|Gentry}}
The distinction between the ranks of the major nobility (listed above) and the minor nobility, listed here, was not always a sharp one in all nations. But the precedence of the ranks of a Baronet or a Knight is quite generally accepted for where this distinction exists for most nations. Here the rank of Baronet (ranking above a Knight) is taken as the highest rank among the ranks of the minor nobility or gentry that are listed below.

; Titles
* '''[[Baronet]]''' is a hereditary title ranking below Baron but above Knight; this title is granted only in the British Isles and does not confer nobility.
* '''[[Dominus (title)|Dominus]]''' was the Latin title of the feudal, superior and mesne, lords, and also an ecclesiastical and academical title (equivalent of [[Lord]])
* '''[[Vidame]]''', a minor French aristocrat

* '''[[Fidalgo]]''' or '''[[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|Hidalgo]]''' is a minor Portuguese and Spanish aristocrat (respectively; from ''filho d'algo'', lit. son of wealth, mediaeval Galician-Portuguese &quot;algo&quot; = wealth, riches, fortune, nowadays &quot;algo&quot; = something)
* '''[[Nobile (aristocracy)]]''' is an Italian title of nobility for prestigious families that never received a title
* '''[[Principalía]]''' the aristocratic class of Filipino nobles, through whom the Spanish Monarchs ruled the Philippines during the colonial period (c. 1600s to 1898).
* '''[[Edler]]''' is a minor aristocrat in Germany and Austria during those countries' respective imperial periods.
* '''[[Jonkheer]]''' is an [[honorific]] for members of noble Dutch families that never received a title; An untitled noblewoman is styled ''Jonkvrouw'', though the wife of a ''Jonkheer'' is a ''Mevrouw'' or, sometimes, ''Freule'', which could also be used by daughters of the same
* '''[[Skartabellat|Skartabel]]''' is a minor Polish aristocrat.
* '''[[Scottish feudal barony|Scottish Baron]]''' is a hereditary feudal nobility dignity, outside the [[peerage of Scotland|Scots peerage]], recognised by [[Lord Lyon]] as a member of the Scots ''[[noblesse]]'' and ranking below a Knight but above a Scottish [[Laird]]&lt;ref&gt;Ruling of the Court of the Lord Lyon (26/2/1948, Vol. IV, page 26): &quot;With regard to the words 'untitled nobility' employed in certain recent birthbrieves in relation to the (Minor) Baronage of Scotland, Finds and Declares that the (Minor) Barons of Scotland are, and have been both in this nobiliary Court and in the Court of Session recognised as a 'titled nobility' and that the estait of the Baronage (i.e. ''Barones Minores'') are of the ancient Feudal Nobility of Scotland&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are actually three Scottish dignities that are types of a Scottish Baron; these are (in descending order of rank): [[Feudal earldom|Scottish feudal Earl]], [[Scottish feudal lordship|Scottish Feudal Lord]], and [[Scottish feudal barony|Scottish feudal Baron]] (the general name for the dignity listed above among the ranks of aristocratic gentry).&lt;/ref&gt; in the British system. However, Scottish Barons on the European continent are considered and treated equal to European barons.
* '''[[Laird]]''' is a Scottish hereditary feudal dignity ranking below a Scottish Baron but above an Esquire
* '''[[Esquire]]''' is a rank of [[gentry]] originally derived from [[Squire]] and indicating the status of an attendant to a knight or an apprentice knight; it ranks below Knight (or in Scotland below Laird) but above [[Gentleman]]&lt;ref name=&quot;esquire&quot;&gt;The meaning of the title Esquire became (and remains) quite diffuse, and may indicate anything from no aristocratic status, to some official government civil appointment, or (more historically) the son of a knight or noble who had no other title above just [[Gentleman]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usesquire&quot;&gt;In the United States, where there is no nobility, the title esquire is sometimes arrogated (without any governmental authorization) by lawyers admitted to the state bar.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Junker]]''' is a noble honorific, meaning &quot;young nobleman&quot; or otherwise &quot;young lord&quot;
* '''[[Gentleman]]''' is the basic rank of [[gentry]], historically primarily associated with land or [[manorialism|manorial]] lords; within British Commonwealth nations it is also roughly equivalent to some minor nobility of some continental European nations&lt;ref name=lawrence&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=k04RAQAAIAAJ |last=Larence |first=Sir James Henry |title=The nobility of the British Gentry or the political ranks and dignities of the British Empire compared with those on the continent |edition=2nd |location=London |publisher=T.Hookham -- Simpkin and Marshall |year=1827 |origyear=first published 1824 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bibi (title)|Bibi]]''', means Miss in Urdu and is frequently used as a respectful title for women in South Asia when added to the given name

In Germany, the constitution of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1919 ceased to accord privileges to members of dynastic and noble families. Their titles henceforth became legal parts of the family name, and traditional forms of address (e.g., &quot;Hoheit&quot; or &quot;[[Durchlaucht]]&quot;) ceased to be accorded to them by governmental entities. The last title was conferred on 12 November 1918 to Kurt von Klefeld. The actual rank of a title-holder in Germany depended not only on the nominal rank of the title, but also the degree of [[sovereignty]] exercised, the rank of the title-holder's [[suzerain]], and the length of time the family possessed its status within the nobility (''Uradel, Briefadel, altfürstliche, neufürstliche'', see: [[German nobility]]). Thus, any reigning sovereign ranks higher than any [[abolished monarchy|deposed]] or [[German Mediatisation|mediatized]] sovereign (e.g., the ''[[Fürst]]'' of [[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck]], sovereign until 1918, was higher than the [[Duke of Arenberg]], head of a mediatized family, although ''[[Herzog]]'' is nominally a higher title than ''Fürst''). However, former holders of higher titles in extant monarchies retained their relative rank, i.e., a queen dowager of Belgium outranks the reigning Prince of Liechtenstein. Members of a formerly sovereign or mediatized house rank higher than the nobility. Among the nobility, those whose titles derive from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] rank higher than the holder of an equivalent title granted by one of the German monarchs after 1806.

In Austria, nobility titles may no longer be used since 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;aut&quot;&gt;[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Bundesnormen/NOR12000691/NOR12000691.html Austrian law on noble titles]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Switzerland, nobility titles are prohibited and are not recognized as part of the family name.

==Corresponding titles between languages ==
Below is a comparative table of corresponding royal and noble titles in various European countries.  Quite often, a Latin 3rd declension noun formed a distinctive feminine title by adding -issa to its base, but usually the 3rd declension noun was used for both male and female nobles, except for ''Imperator'' and ''Rex''. 3rd declension nouns are ''italicized'' in this chart.
See [[Royal and noble styles]] to learn how to address holders of these titles properly.

! Finnish&lt;ref name=&quot;fin&quot;&gt;Finland accorded the noble ranks of ''Ruhtinas'', ''Kreivi'', ''Vapaaherra'' and ''Aatelinen''. The titles ''Suurherttua'', ''Arkkiherttua'', ''Vaaliruhtinas'', ''Prinssi'', ''Markiisi'', ''Jaarli'', ''Varakreivi'', ''Paroni'', and ''Baronetti'' were not granted in Finland, though they are used of foreign titleholders. ''Keisari'', ''Kuningas'', ''Suuriruhtinas'', ''Prinssi'', and ''Herttua'' have been used as official titles of members of the dynasties that ruled Finland, though not granted as titles of nobility.  Some feudally-based privileges in landowning, connected to nobily related [[lordship]], existed into the nineteenth century; and [[fief]]s were common in the late medieval and early modern eras.  The title ''Ritari'' was not commonly used except in the context of knightly orders. The lowest, untitled level of hereditary nobility was that of the &quot;Aatelinen&quot; (i.e. &quot;noble&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;

! Polish&lt;ref name=&quot;pol&quot;&gt;In keeping with the principle of equality among noblemen, no noble titles (with few exceptions) below that of prince were allowed in Poland. The titles in ''italics'' are simply Polish translations of western titles which were granted to some Polish nobles by foreign monarchs, especially after the [[partitions of Poland|partitions]]. Instead of hereditary titles, the Polish nobility developed and used [[Offices in Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|a set of titles based on offices held]].

The [[monarchy]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] began with [[Alfred the Great]] and ended with [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], who became Queen of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] when [[Kingdom of England|England]] merged with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] to form a union in 1707. For monarchs after Queen Anne, see [[List of British monarchs]].

Arguments are made for a few different kings deemed to control enough of the ancient kingdoms of the [[Anglo-Saxons]] to be deemed the first King of England. For example [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]], king of [[Mercia]], and [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]], king of [[Wessex]], are sometimes described as kings of England by popular writers, but not by all historians. In the late eighth century Offa achieved a dominance over southern England which did not survive his death in 796. In 829 Egbert conquered Mercia, but he soon lost control of it. By the late ninth century Wessex was the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Its king, Alfred the Great, was overlord of western Mercia and used the title ''King of the Angles and Saxons'', but he never ruled eastern and northern England, which was then the [[Danelaw]]. His son [[Edward the Elder]] conquered the eastern Danelaw, but Edward's son [[Æthelstan]] became the first king to rule the whole of England when he conquered Northumbria in 927, and he is regarded by some modern historians as the first king of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of British Chronology|publisher =Royal Historical Society|year=1996|edition=3rd|editors=E. B. Fryde et al|page=25|isbn=0-521-56350-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Keynes|first= Simon |year=2001|title=Rulers of the English, c.450–1066|editors= Michael Lapidge, John Blair, Simon Keynes and Donald Scragg |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England|publisher= Blackwell Publishing|page=514|isbn=978-0-631-22492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Principality of Wales]] was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of England]] under the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] in 1284, and in 1301 [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] invested his eldest son, the future [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]], as [[Prince of Wales]]. Since that time, except for [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], the eldest sons of all English monarchs have borne this title. After the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] without issue, in 1603, the crowns of England and Scotland were joined in [[personal union]] under [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]], who became James I of England. By royal proclamation, James titled himself &quot;King of Great Britain&quot;, but no such kingdom was created until 1707, when England underwent legislative [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] to form the new [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], during the reign of [[Queen Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1801, the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which had been under English rule since [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]], became part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] following the [[Act of Union (1800)|Act of Union]], which lasted until [[Irish Free State|the secession of Ireland]] in 1922 and the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927|subsequent renaming]] of the state to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disputed claimant'''

There is some evidence that [[Ælfweard of Wessex]] may have been king for four weeks in 924, between his father Edward the Elder and his brother Æthelstan, although he was not crowned.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke, Barbara. ''Bishop Æthelwold: His Career and Influence''. Woodbridge, 1988. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not accepted by all historians. Also, it is unclear whether Ælfweard was declared king of the whole kingdom or of Wessex only: there is evidence that when Edward died, Ælfweard was declared king in Wessex and Æthelstan in Mercia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;&gt;Simon Keynes, 'Rulers of the English, c 450–1066', in Michael Lapidge et al ed., ''The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', 2001, p. 514&lt;/ref&gt;

==House of Normandy==
{{Main|House of Normandy}}
In 1066 [[William the Conqueror|William II, Duke of Normandy]], a vassal to the King of France and first-cousin once-removed of [[Edward the Confessor]], invaded and conquered England in the [[Norman conquest of England]], and made permanent the recent removal of the capital from Winchester to [[London]]. Following the death of [[Harold Godwinson|King Harold II]] in the decisive [[Battle of Hastings]] on 14 October, the Anglo-Saxon ''[[Witenagemot]]'' elected [[Edgar the Ætheling]] king in Harold's place, but Edgar was unable to resist the invaders and was never crowned. William was crowned King William I of England on Christmas Day 1066, in [[Westminster Abbey]], and is today known as William the Conqueror, William the Bastard or William I.

'''Disputed claimants'''

'''[[Empress Matilda]]''' was declared [[heir presumptive]] by her father, Henry I, after the death of her brother on the [[White Ship]], and acknowledged as such by the barons. However, upon Henry I's death, the throne was seized by Matilda's cousin, [[Stephen of England|Stephen of Blois]]. [[The Anarchy]] ensued, with Matilda being a ''de facto'' ruler for a few months in 1141—the first woman so to be—but she was never crowned and is rarely listed as a monarch of England.&lt;ref&gt;Matilda is not listed as a monarch of England in many genealogies within texts, including David Carpenter's ''A Struggle for Mastery'' (2003) pg. 533, W.L. Warren's ''Henry II ''(1973) pg. 176, and John Gillingham's ''The Angevin Empire'' (1984) pg. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Count Eustace IV of Boulogne]]''' (c. 1130 – 17 August 1153) was [[Stephen, King of England#Argument with the church (1145–52)|appointed co-king]] of England by his father, [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]], on 6 April 1152, in order to guarantee his succession to the throne (as was the custom in France, but not in England). However, the [[Pope]] and the Church would not agree to this, and Eustace was not crowned. Eustace died the next year aged 22, during his father's lifetime, and so never became king in his own right.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Mike (1999).

Stephen came to an agreement with Matilda in November 1153 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Wallingford]], where Stephen recognised [[Henry II of England|Henry]], son of Matilda, as the heir-apparent to the throne in lieu of his own son, who had died that August.

The Angevins ruled over the [[Angevin Empire]] during the 12th and 13th centuries, an area stretching from the Pyrenees to Ireland. They did not regard England as their primary home until most of their continental domains were lost by [[John, King of England|John]]. Though the Angevin Dynasty was short-lived, their male line descendants included the House of Plantagenet, the House of Lancaster and the House of York.

The Angevins formulated [[coat of arms of England|England's royal coat of arms]], which usually showed other kingdoms held or claimed by them or their successors, although without [[Lordship of Ireland|representation of Ireland]] for quite some time.

'''Disputed claimant'''

'''[[Louis VIII of France]]''' briefly ruled about half of England from 1216 to 1217 at the conclusion of the [[First Barons' War]] against [[John, King of England|King John]]. On marching into London he was openly received by the rebel barons and citizens of London and proclaimed (though not crowned) king at St Paul's cathedral. Many nobles, including [[Alexander II of Scotland]] for his English possessions, gathered to give homage to him. However, in signing the [[Treaty of Lambeth]] in 1217, Louis conceded that he had never been the legitimate king of England.

==House of Plantagenet==
{{Main|House of Plantagenet}}
The House of Plantagenet effectively started under Henry II of England, though today historians generally refer to Henry II and his sons as the Angevins due to their vast continental Empire. Historians instead begin the Plantagenet line from Henry III when the Plantagenet kings became more English in nature. The Houses of Lancaster and York are [[cadet branches]] of the House of Plantagenet.

===House of Lancaster===
{{Main|House of Lancaster}}

This house descended from Edward III's third surviving son, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]]. Henry IV seized power from Richard II (and also displaced the next in line to the throne, [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Edmund Mortimer]] (then aged 7), a descendant of Edward III's second son, [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]]).

===House of York===
{{Main|House of York}}
The House of York inherited its name from the fourth surviving son of Edward III, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund]], 1st [[Duke of York]], but claimed the right to the throne through Edward III's second surviving son, [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]].

The [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455–1485) saw the throne pass back and forth between the rival houses of Lancaster and York.

==House of Tudor==
{{Main|Tudor dynasty}}
The Tudors descended matrilineally from [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort]], one of the illegitimate children of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]] (third surviving son of Edward III), by Gaunt's long-term mistress [[Katherine Swynford]]. Those descended from English monarchs only through an illegitimate child would normally have no claim on the throne, but the situation was complicated when Gaunt and Swynford eventually married in 1396 (25 years after John Beaufort's birth). In view of the marriage, the church retroactively declared the Beauforts legitimate via a papal bull the same year (also enshrined in an Act of Parliament in 1397). A subsequent proclamation by John of Gaunt's legitimate son, [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]], also recognised the Beauforts' legitimacy, but declared them ineligible ever to inherit the throne. Nevertheless, the Beauforts remained closely allied with Gaunt's other descendants, the Royal [[House of Lancaster]].

John Beaufort's granddaughter [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]] was married to [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond|Edmund Tudor]]. Tudor was the son of Welsh courtier Owain Tewdwr or Tudur  (anglicised to [[Owen Tudor]]) and [[Catherine of Valois]], the widowed queen consort of the Lancastrian [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]]. Edmund Tudor and his siblings were either illegitimate, or the product of a secret marriage, and owed their fortunes to the goodwill of their legitimate half-brother [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]]. When the House of Lancaster fell from power, the Tudors followed. By the late 15th century, the Tudors were the last hope for the Lancaster supporters. Edmund Tudor's son became king as [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] after defeating Richard III at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] in 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses. King Henry married [[Elizabeth of York]], daughter of Edward IV, thereby uniting the Lancastrian and Tudor lineages.

With [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s break from the Roman Catholic Church, the monarch became the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]] and of the [[Church of Ireland]]. [[Elizabeth I|Elizabeth I's]] title became the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].

'''Disputed claimant'''

Edward VI named '''[[Lady Jane Grey]]''' as his [[heir presumptive]], overruling the order of succession laid down by Parliament in the [[Third Succession Act]]. Four days after his death on 6 July 1553, Jane was proclaimed queen—the first of three Tudor women to be proclaimed queen regnant. Nine days after the proclamation, on 19 July, the [[Privy Council]] switched allegiance and proclaimed Edward VI's Catholic half-sister [[Mary I of England|Mary]]. Jane was executed in 1554, aged 16. Many historians do not consider her to have been a legitimate monarch.

Under the terms of the marriage treaty between '''[[Philip II of Spain|Philip I of Naples]]''' (Philip II of Spain from 15 January 1556) and Queen Mary I, Philip was to enjoy Mary's titles and honours for as long as their marriage should last. All official documents, including [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. An Act of Parliament gave him the title of king and stated that he &quot;shall aid her Highness&amp;nbsp;... in the happy administration of her Grace's realms and dominions&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rbsche.people.wm.edu/H111_doc_marriageofqueenmary.html 1 Mar stat. 2 c. 2]&lt;/ref&gt; (although elsewhere the Act stated that Mary was to be &quot;sole queen&quot;).

However, the two parliaments remained separate until the [[Acts of Union 1707]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Act of Union 1707#Article 3 (united parliament)|Article 3 of the Act of Union 1707]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acts of Union==
The [[Acts of Union 1707]] were a pair of [[Act of Parliament|Parliamentary Acts]] passed during 1706 and 1707 by the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] to put into effect the [[Treaty of Union]] agreed on 22 July 1706. The Acts joined the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (previously separate [[sovereign state]]s, with separate legislatures but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]]) into the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/ Welcome] parliament.uk. Retrieved 7 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

England, Scotland, and Ireland had shared a monarch for more than a hundred years, since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English and Irish thrones from his first cousin twice removed, [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head. There had been attempts in 1606, 1667, and 1689, to unite England and Scotland by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early eighteenth century that the idea had the support of both political establishments behind it, albeit for rather different reasons.

For monarchs after 1707, see [[List of British monarchs]].

== Titles ==
{{main|Style of the British sovereign}}

The standard title for all monarchs from [[Æthelstan]] until the time of [[John, King of England|King John]] was ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglorum}}'' (&quot;King of the English&quot;).  In addition, many of the pre-Norman kings assumed extra titles, as follows:
* [[Æthelstan]]: ''{{lang|la|Rex totius Britanniae}}'' (&quot;King of the Whole of Britain&quot;)
* [[Edmund I|Edmund the Magnificent]]: ''{{lang|la|Rex Britanniæ}}'' (&quot;King of Britain&quot;) and ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglorum cæterarumque gentium gobernator et rector}}'' (&quot;King of the English and of other peoples' and director&quot;)
* [[Eadred]]: ''{{lang|la|Regis qui regimina regnorum Angulsaxna, Norþhymbra, Paganorum, Brettonumque}}'' (&quot;Reigning over the governments of the kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons, Northumbrians, Pagans, and British&quot;)
* [[Eadwig|Eadwig the Fair]]: ''{{lang|la|Rex nutu Dei Angulsæxna et Northanhumbrorum imperator paganorum gubernator Breotonumque propugnator}}'' (&quot;King by the will of God, Emperor of the Anglo-Saxons and Northumbrians, governor of the pagans, commander of the British&quot;)
* [[Edgar the Peaceful]]: ''{{lang|la|Totius Albionis finitimorumque regum basileus}}'' (&quot;Autocrat of all Albion and its neighbouring realms&quot;)
* [[Cnut the Great|Canute]]: ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglorum totiusque Brittannice orbis gubernator et rector}}'' (&quot;King of the English and of all the British sphere governor and director&quot;) and ''{{lang|la|Brytannie totius Anglorum monarchus}}'' (&quot;Monarch of all the English of Britain&quot;)

In the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman period]] ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglorum}}'' remained standard, with occasional use of ''{{lang|la|Rex Anglie}}'' (&quot;King of England&quot;). The [[Empress Matilda]] styled herself ''{{lang|la|Domina Anglorum}}'' (&quot;Lady of the English&quot;).

From the time of [[John, King of England|King John]] onwards all other titles were eschewed in favour of ''{{lang|la|Rex}}'' or ''{{lang|la|Regina Anglie}}''.

In 1604 [[James VI and I|James I]], who had inherited the English throne the previous year, adopted the title (now usually rendered in English rather than Latin) ''King of Great Britain''. The English and Scottish parliaments, however, did not recognise this title until the Acts of Union of 1707 under [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] (who was of course ''Queen of Great Britain'' rather than king).&lt;ref&gt;After the [[union of the Crowns|personal union of the crowns]], James was the first to style himself ''King of Great Britain'', but the title was rejected by the [[English Parliament]] and had no basis in law. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] also opposed it. Croft, p67; Wilson, pp249–252. See also [[Union Flag|the early history of the Union Flag]].&lt;/ref&gt;

| {{Royal Navy ship types}}
|}

This is an alphabetical list of all the ''names'' of ships that have ever been in service with the [[Royal Navy]], as well as a list of fictional vessels in literature about the Royal Navy.  Many of the names have been re-used over the years and thus represent more than one ship.

Altogether over 13,000 ships have been in service with the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Colledge and Warlow (2006) ''Page viii''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that, unlike many other naval services, the Royal Navy designates certain types of shore establishment (e.g. [[barracks]], [[List of air stations of the Royal Navy|naval air stations]] and [[List of Royal Navy shore establishments|training establishments]]) as &quot;ships&quot; and names them accordingly. These establishments are often referred to in service slang as ''[[stone frigate]]s''.

==Lists of ship names==

Due to the large number of names the list has been split into smaller lists:

==Fictional RN ship names==
{{see also|List of fictional ships}}

{{Main|Geography of Belize}}
The country of [[Belize]] has roughly 386&amp;nbsp;km of coastline, and has many [[coral reefs]], [[cay]]s, and [[islands]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Most of these form the [[Belize Barrier Reef]], the longest in the western hemisphere stemming approximately {{convert|322|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The reef and its islands have been a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] since 1996.

The following is a list of oceanic islands of Belize, arranged according to region but all of which are in the Caribbean Sea. Most of the islands vary in spelling between &quot;cay&quot; and &quot;caye&quot;, and also use the Spanish &quot;cayo&quot;. [[River island]]s have not been listed.

===Central groups===
This group of islands form an arch around the [[Belize City|capital city's]] coastline.

===Southern groups===
Gradually heading in a line southward, the cays decrease in size before reaching the coast of [[Honduras]]. and finally, towards the coast of [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]] are some more islands.

===Turneffe Atoll===
The [[Turneffe Atoll]] is situated in the central Barrier Reef system, between the Inner Channel and Lighthouse Reef, and is 30 miles (48&amp;nbsp;km) long and 10 miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) wide. It is made up of a number of large cayes, such as [[Blackbird Caye]], which surround a central lagoon. Smaller surrounding islands include:

===Lighthouse Reef===
[[File:Great Blue Hole.jpg|thumb|250px|link=|alt=|The Lighthouse Reef's most famous site is the [[Great Blue Hole]], located at its centre.]]
The Lighthouse Reef system is a sunken atoll, and consists of four islands:

This is a '''list of [[alternative hip hop]] artists'''.

Alternative hip hop fuses traditional hip hop with elements from other musical genres, such as [[reggae]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[jazz]], or even [[Orchestra|orchestral music]] (such as [[Jay Electronica]]). It is usually independent, although some artists have achieved mainstream success.

Alternative hip hop is a distinctive genre of [[Political hip hop#Conscious hip hop|conscious hip hop]], but can even incorporate elements from [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]].

It also typically discards hardcore rap themes like street violence, though not always, as some groups like [[Cypress Hill]] retain this. Plus, some alternative hip-hop acts openly rap about [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] usage and sex just as their [[gangsta rap]] counterparts. Still, alternative hip hop does what most gangsta rap does not do{{spaced ndash}} it delivers philosophical, social and emotional messages.

This is a list of notable musicians who play their instruments [[left-handed]]. (This does not include left-handed people who play right-handed, such as [[Duane Allman]], [[Billy Corgan]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Barry Gibb]], and [[Paul Simon]].)&lt;!-- Do not add more left-handed people who play right-handed.  See talk. --&gt;

== Guitarists &amp; Bassists==
[[File:Paul McCartney on stage in Prague.jpg|right|thumb|[[Paul McCartney]] playing a true left-handed guitar (a [[Gibson Les Paul]]).]]
Left-handed people play [[guitar]] or [[bass guitar|electric bass]] in either one of the following four ways depending on the person: (1) play a right-handed guitar or bass right-handed, (2) play a true left-handed guitar or bass, (3) play a right-handed guitar or bass that has been altered to play left-handed, or (4) turn a right-handed guitar or bass upside down, pick with the left hand, but leave the strings as they were – which makes them reversed from the normal order for a left-handed player. (The fingering is the same for methods 2 and 3.)  Any style of picking with the left hand ([[flatpicking]] or [[fingerstyle guitar]]) is considered playing left-handed.

=== Left-handed with normal stringing ===
Guitarists in this category pick with their left hand and have the strings in the conventional order for a left-handed player (i.e. the low string on the top side of the neck). They either have true left-handed guitars or have right-handed guitars altered so the strings are correct for a left-handed player. Some guitarists in this category (e.g. Paul McCartney) play both genuine left-handed instruments and right-handed instruments altered for left-handed playing.

Changing the strings on a right-handed guitar involves several things. The [[Nut (string instrument)|nut]] of the guitar has to be changed to accommodate the string widths. The [[Bridge (instrument)|bridge]] needs to be changed to make the lower strings longer than the top strings for correct [[Intonation (music)|intonation]]. On almost all [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitars]] the bracing is non-symmetrical. On [[electric guitar]]s altered this way, the controls will be backwards.

=====Notes=====
* Jimi Hendrix was naturally left-handed but his father tried to force him to play right-handed because he believed playing left handed was a sign of the devil. Hendrix took right-handed guitars and restrung them for playing left-handed {{harvcol|Cross|2005|p=55}}.  Hendrix did continue to write right-handed. Jimi did learn to play right-handed as mandated by his father, he had to play right-handed any time his father was around (and left-handed, upside down, when his father was not around) or risked losing the guitar forever.  Once he started making modifications that allowed him to play left handed with the strings in the proper order, he still had to play right-handed with the old man nearby, so he also learned to play right-handed with the strings upside down. His brother Leon's testimony confirms this in Sharon Lawrence's biography &quot;Jimi Hendrix: the man, the magic, the truth&quot; and in quotations from guitar players such as Mike Bloomfield in &quot;Jimi Hendrix: Voodoo Child of the Aquarian Age&quot; by Dave Henderson.

=== Left-handed with strings backwards ===
These are players who play left-handed, but with the strings as on an unaltered right-handed guitar, thus the strings are backwards for a left-handed player (e.g. Bob Geldof). Some players in this category (e.g. Dick Dale and Albert King) had custom instruments that were basically a left-handed guitar with the strings as on a right-handed guitar, since they had learned to play that way.

This is a '''list of [[novelist]]s from the [[United States]]''', listed with titles of a major work for each.

This is not intended to be a list of every American (born U.S. citizen, naturalized citizen, or long-time resident alien) who has published a [[novel]]. (For the purposes of this article, ''novel'' is defined as an extended work of [[fiction]]. This definition is loosely interpreted to include novellas, novelettes, and books of interconnected short stories.) [[Novelist]]s on this list have achieved a notability that exceeds merely having been published. The writers on the current list fall into one or more of the following categories:

# All American novelists who have articles in Wikipedia should be on this list, and even if they do not clearly meet any other criteria they should not be removed until the article itself is removed.
# Winner of a major literary prize, even if the winning work was a story collection rather than a novel: The [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]], The PEN American Center Book Awards, the [[National Book Award#Fiction|National Book Award]], the [[American Book Award]], the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]], the [[Orange Prize for Fiction|Orange Prize]], and some others. (Note: The only Pulitzer winner for Fiction not on the list is [[James Alan McPherson]], who has never published a novel.)
# Having a substantial body of work, widely respected and reviewed in major publications, and perhaps often nominated or a finalist for major awards.
# A pioneering literary figure, possibly for the style or substance of their entire body of work, or for a single novel that was a notable &quot;first&quot; of some kind in U.S. literary history.
# Had several massive bestsellers, or even just one huge seller that has entered the cultural lexicon ([[Grace Metalious]] and ''[[Peyton Place (novel)|Peyton Place]]'', for example).
# A leading figure—especially award winning, and with crossover appeal to mainstream readers, reviewers, and scholars—in a major genre or subcategory of fiction: [[Romance novel|Romance]], [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], [[Western fiction|western]], [[Young adult literature|young adult fiction]], [[American literary regionalism|regional or &quot;local color&quot; fiction]], [[proletarian literature|proletarian fiction]], etc.
